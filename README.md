# PHANTOMJulia

## Goal
In order to analysis the files which is generated by the Hydrodynamics in a more intuitive way, and prevent the efficiency of analysis as much as possible.

## Motivation
PHANTOM has provide some method to analysis the result. However, for those who does not familiar to FORTRAN, it is too hard to prevent all of the part of analysis working fine. Therefore, the code which is written by Julia and Python can help the research to analysis it more intuitive.

## Method
**Julia** and **Python** would be used for analysis. We will read the raw data by the package *Sarracen*, transforming to the other format for analysis.
